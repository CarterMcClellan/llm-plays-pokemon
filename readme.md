# Run the game
after legally optaining a gbc file, place it in the root directoyr of the repo with the name `red.gbc`

# Goals
Build an ai agent which can beat pokemon red - the way a human would, by just looking at the screen and taking actions. Not by
having some massive prior of knowledge about the game.

# Play the Game Manually
```bash
python main.py rom --manual red.gbc
```

# Run the Game with the AI Agent
```bash
python main.py rom red.gbc
```
